# LeifsFirstIPlugEffect
A basic volume control effect plug-in with IGraphics GUI

I'm using the iPlug2 project and its dependencies, of which you can find here: https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2. Kudos, thanks, shout-outs to Oli Larkin, Alex Harker and any other contributors on that. Really, great job.

I customized the wicked cool backgrounds in this plugin at SVGBackgrounds.com. (Neat place to get some quick SVG backgrounds btw)
